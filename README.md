# dinosour_namegen

Create new dinosaur names, I built a character level language model to generate new names. The algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names.

Synthesize data, by sampling predictions at each time step and passing it to the next RNN-cell unit.
Try to build a character-level text generation recurrent neural network.
